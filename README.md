# SOFT166 Lights Application

# Application Fact Sheet
My website is set out into 4 pages. Index, About, Light and Light Application

Throughout the website, there is a navigation bar with some buttons on the top of the page> Clicking
any of these buttons will take you to the corresponding page. The navigation bar was made with HTML
and a CSS style applied. Included in thee index page are extra buttons to take you to the light switch and
light application pages. I included these because I wanted to advertise these games more.

The about page includes a small description about the project, hosted in a styled <div> tag
  
The light switch application has a table with 6 <td> fields. When clicking one of the fields the
corresponding light in SMB109 will toggle on with the same colour. You can also turn all the lights on
and turn all the lights off using two buttons at the bottom of the page.
  
In the Application Page you can play a Simon Says memory game. When your press the start button a
random field will flash. You are then prompted to remember and click the following fields, increasing in
length each time. The sequence is also displayed on the lights in SMB109, resetting each sequence.
When you get the sequence wrong, all the lights turn red. Also, when you complete the sequence 5
times in a row, all he lights will turn green.
